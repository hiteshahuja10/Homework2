For this assignment, I decided to continue adding on to my scene from Homework 1, which represents a bedroom that is created using various unity assets. I added lighting into my scene, created a day/night cycyle, and created a particle system that has snow falling from the sky.

Point Distribution:

Part One (Lighting): 30 Points
  - Point Light (It is pointed at the robot)
  - Spot Light (It is pointed at the storage shelf)
  - Directional Light (Pointed at TV)
  - Emissive Material Light (Next to computer desk and the color is light green)

Part Two (Day/Night Cycle): 30 Points
  - When the scene is played, the scene switches from daytime to nightime in a cycle.

Part Three (Particle System): 30 Points
  - I created a 2D texture emitter particle system that has snow falling from the sky when the scene is played. I decided to use snow since the setting of the scene is in a snow mountain.
